## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some of my projects:

:clipboard: _A clinical screening tool for precision psychiatry: which depression patients will be responsive to SSRIs?_ R implementation of a [machine learning classifier](https://github.com/xliu5899/ARD_reward) for predicting depression treatment response from a self-report questionnaire.

:+1: _Looking for a social reward task that is ecologically valid?_ PsychoPy and MATLAB implementations of a [social incentive delay task](https://github.com/xliu5899/SID) used in neuroimaging research to separately measure brain activity in response to anticipating reward and receiving reward.

:brain: The [Virtual Day](https://github.com/xliu5899/VirtualDayGame) is a modified version of a memory game implemented in Python that tests your ability to remember tasks to do later. Examples include remembering to take vitamins with dinner or picking up milk on your way home from work.
