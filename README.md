## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some of my projects:

:clipboard: _Can we build a clinical screening tool for predicting which depression patients will be responsive to SSRIs?_ R implementation of a [machine learning classifier] (https://github.com/xliu5899/ARD_reward) for predicting depression treatment response from self-report questions.

:+1: _Looking for a social incentive delay task that doesn't use faces and is more ecologically valid?_ PsychoPy and MATLAB implementations of a [social incentive delay task] (https://github.com/xliu5899/SID) used in neuroimaging research to separately measure brain activity in response to anticipating reward and receiving reward.

:brain: The [Virtual Day] (https://github.com/xliu5899/VirtualDayGame) is a modified version of a game implemented in Python that assesses _prospective memory_, which is the ability to carry out tasks at a later time or date. Examples include remembering to take vitamins with dinner or picking up milk on your way home from work.
